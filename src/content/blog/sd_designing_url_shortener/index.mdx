## Intro
In this blog post, I will share my personal solution for the "Hello World" of System Design interviews: designing a URL shortener service.
This is a common question that is often asked in technical interviews to assess a candidate's ability to design scalable and efficient systems.

The goal of this exercise is to design a URL shortener service that can take a long URL and generate a shorter,
more manageable URL that redirects to the original long URL when accessed.

In the following sections, I will go through the different stages of the system design process, including
requirements elicitation, API design, core entities, and finally a deep dive into the design of the URL shortener service.
