Now let's talk about the core entities of our system. What are the actors and objects that we need to model
to make our URL shortener work?

## The URL mapping
The most fundamental entity in our system is the URL mapping, which represents the relationship between a long URL and its corresponding short URL.
This entity will have the following attributes:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the URL mapping.
- `longUrl`: The original long URL that the user wants to shorten.
- `shortUrl`: The generated short URL that maps to the long URL.
- `customAlias`: An optional custom alias for the short URL, if the user chooses to create one.
- `expirationDate`: An optional expiration date for the short URL, after which it will no longer be valid.
- `createdAt`: The timestamp when the URL mapping was created.


## Analytics
To provide analytics on the usage of our URL shortener, we can also model a Click entity that represents each click on a short URL. This entity will have the following attributes:
- `shortUrl`: The generated short URL that maps to the long URL.
- `clickCount`: A counter to track the number of times the short URL has been clicked
- `lastAcessed`: The timestamp of the last time the short URL was accessed.

And that's it!

This is enough to model the core functionality of our URL shortener.
We can always add more attributes or entities later on as we need them, but this is a good starting point for our design.
