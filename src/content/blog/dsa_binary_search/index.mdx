## Introduction
Binary search is a powerful algorithm used to efficiently find the position of a target value within a sorted array.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which allows it to quickly narrow down the possible locations of the target value.
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), making it much faster than linear search for large datasets.

## The search space
This is the main concept that we must understand to be able to implement and customize our binary search algorithms.

The search space is the portion of the data structure that we are currently examining to find the target value.
In the context of binary search, the search space is defined by two pointers: `left` and `right`, which represent the
indices of the current interval of the array being searched.

This interval is continuously halved until we find the target value or determine that it is not present in the array.
The efficiency of binary search relies on the fact that the data structure is sorted, allowing us to make informed decisions
about which half of the search space to explore next.

This search space interval can be open or closed, depending on the implementation. In a closed interval, both `left` and `right` are inclusive,
meaning that the search includes the elements at both indices. In an open interval,
one of the pointers is exclusive, which can lead to different conditions for the loop termination.

## Variations of Binary Search
Binary search can be adapted to solve various problems beyond just finding a target value in a sorted array. Some common variations include:
- [Finding a target value (classic binary search)](./dsa_binary_search/search_by_value)
- [Finding the first value that satisfies a condition.](./dsa_binary_search/search_by_boundary)
- Finding the smallest or largest element in a rotated sorted array.
- Finding the peak element in an array.
- Finding the square root of a number using binary search.

In the following subposts, we will explore some of these variations in detail, providing implementations and explanations for each scenario.
